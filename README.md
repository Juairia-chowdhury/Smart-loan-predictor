Dataset Overview
The project uses a dataset containing historical loan application data. Key features include:

## Applicant Information: Income, employment status, credit history, etc.
. Loan Information: Loan amount, term, type, etc.
. Outcome: Whether the loan was approved or rejected.
. Data Preprocessing
 . Handling missing values.
. Encoding categorical features.
. Normalizing and scaling continuous features.

# 1. Data Preprocessing
Run the data_preprocessing.py script to clean and preprocess the data:


#2. Model Training
Train the predictive model using the [[train_model.py](https://github.com/Juairia-chowdhury/Smart-loan-predictor/blob/main/FINAL_PROJECT(Loan_Predication).ipynb)] script:
